<h1>CSc 453 : Programming Assignment 4 (Code Generation)</h1>

<h3>Start Date: Tue Nov 3, 2015</h3>

<h3>Due Date: 11:59 PM, Mon Nov. 23, 2015</h3>

<h2>1. General</h2>
This assignment involves generating assembly code for C--.  The
generated code should adhere to the
<a href="../DOCS/cminusminusspec.html#opsem">
operational semantics of C--</a>.

<h3>The Target Architecture</h3>

The target architecture for this assignment will be the MIPS R2000
processor.  Your compiler will generate assembly code for this processor;
this assembly code will be executed using the
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/spim.html">SPIM simulator</a>.
(The code is free: it is available on <b>lectura</b>, and executables
for PCs running MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows, together with
documentation, are available from
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/spim.html">the SPIM homepage</a>.
<i>However, note that SPIM inherits the endian-ness of the underlying
processor, and this can cause it to give different results for the
same program on different machines.</i>)

<h3>Output Operations</h3>

These will be implemented using functions <b>print_int()</b> and 
<b>print_string</b>, as for <a href="prog4_codegen-milestone1.html">Milestone 1</a>.

<h3>Supporting Documents</h3>

The following documents may be useful for this assignment:

<ul>
<li> <a href="../DOCS/intcode.html">
     A Three-Address Intermediate Code Instruction Set for C--</a>
<li> SPIM User Manual [ 
     <a href="../DOCS/spim.ps">Postscript</a>
   | <a href="../DOCS/spim.pdf">PDF</a>
     ]
<li> Notes on translating Three-address Code to MIPS Assembly Code [
     <a href="../DOCS/3addr2spim.ps">Postscript </a>
   | <a href="../DOCS/3addr2spim.pdf">PDF</a>
     ]
</ul>

<h2>2. Output</h2>
As before, your program will take its input from <b>stdin</b> and generate all
output on <b>stdout</b>.  Error messages, if any, will be sent to <b>stderr</b>.
In case any errors are encountered during lexical or syntax analysis
or during type checking, you should stop generating code, but continue
to process the user program as best as possible.

<h2>3. Turnin</h2>
You should turn in all the sources to all the phases of your compiler.
You should also turn in a Makefile that supports at least the
following:

<dl>
<dt>
<b>make clean</b> 
</dt>
<dd>
remove all <b>*.o</b> files as well as the
file <b>compile</b> from the current directory.
</dd>
<dt><b>make compile</b> :
<dd>
Creates an executable file in the current directory called <b>compile</b>
that implements your compiler.  Note that this should build your compiler
from scratch, i.e. starting from the lex specification.</dd>
</dl>
To turn in your program, execute the command 
<b>turnin&nbsp;&nbsp; cs453f15-assg4</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>files</i>.

<h2>4. Milestones</h2>

There is one intermediate milestone for this assignment, the spec for this
is available <a href="prog4_codegen-milestone1.html">here</a>.
